Bejeweled
==========

A basic version of Bejeweled written for an Intro to Java course.  Only the second tile clicked in the swap is checked for a match.  To run, simply compile the java class then run "java Jewels" or "java Jewels [rows] [columns] [number of types of jewels]".  Run the version in the Extra Credit folder for cute animal graphics and sound.
